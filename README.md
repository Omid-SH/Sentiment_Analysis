# Tweet Sentiment Analysis
#### Tweet Sentiment Analysis using one-directional, bi-directional, pyramid LSTM and BERT in TensorFlow.

#### In this notebook, I will analyze the sentiment of users based on their tweets. 
#### I use Sentiment140 dataset. Preprocessing contains removing all hashtags and mentions in tweets. I also remove all tweets containing links inside. Also, some routine preprocessing, such as removing numbers and punctuation marks, has been done.
#### Models I used :


*  One direction LSTM
*  Bidirectional LSTM
*  Pyramid LSTM
*  BERT model in TensorFlow

#### I did tokenizing of words and made embedding layer of the networks by myself, except for the Bert network part that I obtained the TensorFlow document rule. https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/fine_tune_bert

#### I saved and uploaded the trained models and their history on the [ repository](https://github.com/Omid-SH/Sentiment_Analysis).
